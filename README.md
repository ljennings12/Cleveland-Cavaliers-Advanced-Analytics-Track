# Cleveland-Cavaliers-Advanced-Analytics-Track
Our team was announced as the winner of the 2023 Cleveland Cavaliers Advanced Analytics Hackathon.

Our challenge was to create tiers for the Cavaliers home games for the 2023/24 season and showcase the insights in ten days. We were able to add to the data the Cavaliers provided and weighted our variables to bring meaning to their significance. We then utilized a k-means clustering algorithm to group the games and put them into four tiers. Using the cluster centers, we were able to interpret the results and provide insight into each tier. We also constructed a presentation of our findings to showcase our tiers and discuss our code in a manner that would be easily understandable for all audiences.

The Microsoft PowerPoint with voiceover slides, R code, and data are attached.
